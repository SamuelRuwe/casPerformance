		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p class="fragment fade-up">
			While this is definitely a major time sink, it is related 
			more to how we choose to process data than the java algorithm. The 
			benefit from attempting to improve this would likely be minimal. As 
			such, I recommend we don't attempt to adjust this until we have fixed 
			the other problem areas.
